## CMU Software Engineering Capstone, Spring 2019

## About
This simply runs `gdal_translate` by itself.  Something we needed for our software engineering project.

Simply cd into the folder and type 

```
gdal_translate inputFile.pdf outputFile.tif
```

or whatever compatible files you want to convert.

For more information, please visit [the gdal_translate documentation](https://gdal.org/gdal_translate.html).
